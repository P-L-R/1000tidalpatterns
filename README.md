# 1000tidalpatterns
Repository to share patterns and daily ideas/practice for use with [Tidal](https://tidalcycles.org/) 

* The plan is to practice using Tidal everyday and to build a collection of documented patterns and functions for use with the Tidal language.  

## Inspired by [Kindohm's 365tidalpatterns](https://github.com/kindohm/365tidalpatterns)

TODO:
1. Connect streaming service to listen to patterns
2. upload functions.tidal file
3. upload custom samples
4. folder for midi patterns
