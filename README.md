# 1000tidalpatterns
* Repository to share livecoding patterns and daily ideas/practice for use with [Tidal](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal). 

# TidalCyles
TidalCyles was created by [Alex McLean](https://twitter.com/yaxu)


From the [homepage](https://tidalcycles.org/):
* "TidalCycles (or Tidal for short) is a language for live coding patterns. It allows you to make musical patterns with text, describing sequences and ways of transforming and combining them, exploring complex interactions between simple parts."


## Inspired by [Kindohm's 365tidalpatterns](https://github.com/kindohm/365tidalpatterns)

* The plan is to practice using Tidal everyday and to build a collection of documented patterns and functions for use with the Tidal platform.  


TODO:
1. Connect streaming service to listen to patterns
2. upload functions.tidal file
3. upload custom samples
4. folder for midi patterns
